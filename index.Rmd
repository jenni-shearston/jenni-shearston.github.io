**Hello!** I'm an environmental epidemiologist with an interest in  environmental monitoring, women's health, environmental justice, and community/science partnerships. During my public health career, I've worked on numerous projects in the United States and abroad, ranging from measuring volatile organic compound emissions at gas stations in the US to developing epidemiologic surveys to measure smoking rates in the United Arab Emirates. I have two main research areas: (1) outdoor and indoor air pollution and chemical exposure, including exposure to air pollutants from traffic, gas stations, and petroleum sources, as well as indoor pollutants like secondhand exposure to hookah, cigarettes, or electronic cigarettes. (2) The intersection of menstruation and environmental health, including exposure to environmental chemicals through use of menstrual products like tampons, and the use of menstrual blood samples to measure reproductive-system exposure to harmful chemicals.
